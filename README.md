Experience
==========

In order to study subjective experience, psychologists rely on self-report data. Most
of these measures, however, are collected retrospectively and may suffer from recall
biases. Researchers have long been aware of the fact that people are unreliable and
often unable to provide accurate retrospective information about their daily behaviour
and experience (Larson & Csikszentmihalyi, 1983). For example, how you remember
feeling yesterday after lunch might be quite different from how you actually felt at that
moment. This is because thinking about a particular experience retrospectively outside
of the context of the situation allows distortions and rationalizations to play a role in how
we reconstruct a particular experience. Thus, data collected retrospectively will suffer
from the same shortcomings. In the 1970’s, psychologists realized that a more
ecologically valid method of studying subjective experience would be to collect such
data at the exact moment an event takes place. Researchers took advantage of the
emerging “beeper” technologies of the time for use in this type of research. Signalling
devices were carried by participants who were instructed to make notes of their current
subjective experience upon the triggering of the device’s alarm at random points in time.
This research methodology became known as the Experience-Sampling Method (ESM).
The general purpose of this technique is to study the subjective experience of people as
they interact in their natural environment, in a way to ensures ecological validity. The
goal of this work is to identify and analyze how patterns in people’s subjective
experience relate to wider conditions of their lives such as mental health and well-being
(Hektner et al., 2006).

Since the 1980’s this methodology has been modified and improved as allowed by
the available technology. For example, in the 1990’s as PDA’s became available
researchers developed compatible ESM software. In the early 2000’s, as smartphones
began to emerge, researchers developed software compatible with Windows Mobile.
Surprisingly, however, despite the explosion in smartphone use and development, no
significant updates have been made to this methodology, and to date there are no
dedicated applications available for either Android or iPhone.
The current project takes advantage of some of the technologies available in today’s
devices and makes significant improvements over previous experience sampling
methods. Our goal was to develop an application that would be ready for use by
psychology researchers to study subjective experience.
